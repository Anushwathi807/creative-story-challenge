This is a placeholder file to remind you that you need to add two images for the web interface:

1. image1.jpeg - The image of a child with a key by a tree (first image you uploaded)
2. image2.jpeg - The image of a child opening a door (second image you uploaded)

Place these images in the same directory as the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

If you want to use different filenames or formats, you'll need to update the <img> src attributes in the index.html file.
